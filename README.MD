In this personal project, I have build a model to classify customer into different credit risk category.

**Note:** The use of credit score can lead to 99% accurate credit risk estimation, I intentionally excluded it from modeling and deployment in this project. The reason is that credit scores lack interpretability, similar to PCA, and are derived by credit agencies.

### Dataset Information:
    * bank_data.xlsx: this dataset contains credit card and loan account records of more than 50k customer
